# KAN-Models
Trying to build some models using KAN [Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756)

~~Using the [pykan package](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan)~~

The KAN is implemented from: [Blealtan/efficient-kan](https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan)

## Working
[Initial attempts at MNIST](./MNIST/MINST.md)
- Processed by simply expanding it into one dimension, which achieves 83 % accuracy

- Replace the linear function in a normal CNN network, achieves 99.17% accuracy
